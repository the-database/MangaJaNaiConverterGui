# Info
MangaJaNaiConverterGui is a convenient GUI windows tool, but in the backend it operates by running some python scripts in CLI.

This README is for those interested in running only the CLI on a linux systems or WSL.

# Setup
## Setup virtual environment and download dependencies
Navigate to `MangaJaNaiConverterGui/chaiNNer/backend/src/` and execute these commands:
```commandline
python -m venv mangajanai
source mangajanai/bin/activate
pip install -r linux-cli-requirements.txt
```
This script will create a new python virtual environment, switch to it and download all required dependencies.

By default, it uses pytorch for CUDA 12.1 compute platform. If you wish to change it, install proper version based on instruction from their [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 

## Download models
Scripts expect all MangaJaNai models to be available in order to select the best one for each processed file. When running it as CLI on linux, put them in `MangaJaNaiConverterGui/chaiNNer/models` folder.

You can extract them from the release .exe file of the version you wish to use.


# Usage
Script uses a settings file generated by the GUI to control its behavior. You need to build it manually to use the CLI. 
The default settings can be found in [MangaJaNaiConverterGui/appstate2.json](MangaJaNaiConverterGui/appstate2.json). Just copy it and modify only what you need. 
It's a long file, but you only need to worry about a few root keys and first workflow `Upscale Manga (Default)`

// TODO - Add some convenient CLI params to control behavior without having to pass this big json.

## Important Root Keys
- **SelectedDeviceIndex** - Controls which GPU should run upscaling jobs. If default doesn't work for you, check your devices by running [device_list.py](MangaJaNaiConverterGui/chaiNNer/backend/src/device_list.py)  
- **UseCPU** - true/false
- **UseFp16** - true/false

## Important Workflows Keys
- **SelectedTabIndex** - Choose if you want to upscale a single file or a whole folder 
  - 0 - file
  - 1 - folder
- **InputFilePath** - absolute file path. Used when **SelectedTabIndex** = 0
- **InputFolderPath** - absolute folder path. Used when **SelectedTabIndex** = 1
- **OutputFilename** - Name of generated filenames. Keep `%filename%` to leave the same name
- **OutputFolderPath** - absolute folder path.
- **OverwriteExistingFiles** - true/false
- **UpscaleImages** - true/false - needs to be true for upscale to work
- **WebpSelected/AvifSelected/PngSelected/JpegSelected** - true/false. Only one should be true. Selects output filetype.
- **UpscaleScaleFactor** - 1/2/3/4 - How much you want to upscale which controls which models will be used
- There are a bunch of other options if you want to dig deeper into it, but setting these should be enough for basic usage

## Execution
In `MangaJaNaiConverterGui/chaiNNer/backend/src/` directory run:
```bash
python runmangajanaiconverterguiupscale.py --settings "/path/to/your/file/appstate2.json"
```
